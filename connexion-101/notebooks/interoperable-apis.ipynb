    "REST, aka REpresentation State Transfer, is not a protocol, but an architectural style which mimics the distributed characteristics of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "In REST, everything is a `resource` whom state is transferred between an Origin Server and a User Agent. There are no \"functions\" but everything is modeled with a resource-like approach. The main advantage of using a REST\n",
    "architectural style is that you can leverage the distributed nature of the web and the features of HTTP which\n",

    "\n",
    "When creating a web service, it's important to have an Interface Description Language. That's a machine readable\n",
    "language that can be used to describe the interface. The most famous IDL is WSDL used by SOAP web services. For REST APIs the standard IDL is OpenAPI v3 aka OAS3.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a web service accepting the following request `GET /echo` and returning a json object could be described in OAS3 like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "paths:\n",
    "  /echo:\n",
    "    get:\n",

    "        \"200\":\n",
    "          application/json: {}\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows to disambiguate the API definitions and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can usually find two approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- code first: where one develops a function on a specific language and then uses some tool to generate the\n",
    "  IDL. An example function generating the above IDL could be\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  def echo():\n",
    "      return {\"hello\": \"world\"}, 200, {'content-type': 'application/json'}\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- contract first: one writes down the interface in an IDL, then let the tools generate the code stubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While lazy developers prefers to use code-first, as they could focus on writing the actual code and leave the interface as an underproduct, this approach rarely works in a large ecosystem where different actors in a long timeframe works with different frameworks and enviroments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A contract-first approach has many advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- allows to focus on the actual design of the API, without being entangled by implementation details;\n",
    "- it's independent from which framework or language people uses for its client/server implementation and from how frameworks generate the specs (which may be buggy);\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on the specs, allows to create API modeling iterations that enable\n",
    "the API to change fast and involve stakeholders in the modeling and in the \n",
    "API lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: this doesn't mean iterations don't involve testing that the actual code works ;)\n"
